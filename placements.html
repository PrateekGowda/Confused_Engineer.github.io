            <p>It‚Äôs happening. It‚Äôs finally happening. The 3 years I spent in college is all going to be showcased this year, apparently. I know this is just a phase. It‚Äôs a test of my grit and patience. It can get a little overwhelming sometimes but I know I can get through this.</p>

            <p>I don‚Äôt want to sugarcoat this but FINAL YEAR IS STRESSFUL.  I am stressing about everything. I have been speaking about this to many of my friends to get some perspective because honestly I don‚Äôt know, I am not able to make any sense out of it.</p>

            <p>Some are working harder than they let on and others are doing much less work than they say. Either way, it doesn‚Äôt matter because everybody works differently and everybody has slightly different workloads.</p>

            

          


           <!-- <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before ‚Äì that‚Äôs what living is all about.</span> -->

            <p>So placements in college start off with an aptitude test (written by 1000 people) about 40 people are selected for the next round and then there are a few more rounds and finally 4-5 people actually get the job. The first few days it‚Äôs all fun because you get to bunk college to attend placement which goes on for about two hours..but then you get results and it gets a little weird when your friends get shortlisted and you don‚Äôt. Trust me, I never thought I‚Äôd feel this way, but it does feel horrible.</p>

            <p>You‚Äôre not feeling particularly friendly. All you can think is, ‚ÄúWhy him/her? What has he/she got that I don‚Äôt?‚Äù The next time you cross paths, you might smile and say, ‚ÄúHey, congrats! I‚Äôm happy for you. You‚Äôre perfect for the job.‚Äù When in reality, you‚Äôre boiling over with bitterness and disappointment. (AHH, how cruel üòõ )</p>

            <p>Which leads to even more negative feelings. Like: ‚ÄúWhat kind of a person am I, jealously resenting my friend‚Äôs success? I‚Äôm awful. No wonder I didn‚Äôt get the job.‚Äù  </p>

            <p>Sound familiar?  </p>

            <p>If you haven‚Äôt already been on this particular roller coaster ride, someday, you probably will. But here‚Äôs the good news: Jealousy doesn‚Äôt have to ruin your life, your career, or your friendships. In fact, it can be a powerful motivating force‚Äîwhen you know how to use it.  </p>

            <p>To be honest, it makes me work harder than I already am. And it‚Äôs all about how you make use of every little setback in life. These little disappointments and how you approach them is what life is all about.  </p>

            <p>If you want to release jealousy for good, the best thing you can do is recognize that when it comes to your job hunt (and your entire life actually) there are certain things that you can control‚Äîplenty of others that you can‚Äôt. In the field of emotional wellness, this technique is called ‚Äúpositive submission.‚Äù It‚Äôs not about giving up. It‚Äôs about placing your focus on things you can change and improve, rather than obsessing over things that you can‚Äôt. So, make a pledge with yourself to accept what is‚Äîand decide what‚Äôs next.  </p>

            <p>To all of you going through this phase in your life, ITS GOING TO BE OKAY. This is just the start of your career! It‚Äôs all going to be good.üòõ  </p>
