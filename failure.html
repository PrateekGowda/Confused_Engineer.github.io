            <p>Sounds like a GD topic, I know. A few days back my friend and I were talking about regrets and I just realized I have no regrets. I actually don't and hopefully won't in the future. So my friend was talking to me about his regrets and what I realized was failing at something once/twice/ a hundred times is way better than having regrets. He looked helpless and this is why I decided to write about this. Tell me your take on this.</p>

            <h5>Regret is the worst because you don’t want to live with thoughts like…..</h5>

<ul>
  <li> I should have studied hard for my boards (after poor performance in exams).</li>
<li> I should have joined dance classes.</li>
 <li>I should have participated in that race, I had a better timing than the winner (after the race).</li>
 <li>I should have talked to her once (on the last day of school/college).</li>
 <li>I should have spent more time with my parents instead of wasting my time in other things (before leaving for hostel).</li>
 <li>I should have socialized more as a kid (an introvert).</li>
 <li>I should have been more careful while crossing the road (after an injury in accident).</li>
 <li>I shouldn't have wimped out of that situation. (which got worse later).</li></ul>
 <p>So instead of regretting for something later in life, it is better to give it a try now because who knows you may <b>succeed.</b> </p>
          
            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="sam_img/failure.jpg" alt="">
            </a>

            
           
           <p> And even if you fail, it does not give you the benefit of doubt. You know you have tried. After all, failure is one step closer to success, and trust me, nothing is as sad as feeling- you COULD HAVE/ SHOULD HAVE done something else. Never have regrets. Go out, do the things you want to. Stop procrastinating. Do your future self a favor and start working today. And in case you did something wrong DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT, look for solutions. There is so much to do in life, so many people to meet. DO NOT DWELL ON SADNESS.</p>
<p>So you failed in your exam- one way to cope with this is by sitting and complaining and giving yourself reasons for why you failed, another way would be to introspect and actually solve the problem instead of giving reasons. TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THIS, EVERYONE FAILS AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER. The topper in your class, the coolest friend of yours, the dude with the coolest bike, the girl who seems to be put together always.. EVERYONE HAS PROBLEMS but the only difference is how you decide to solve it.</p>
<p>Don’t let the fear of what could happen, make nothing happen.</p>
<p>Answers are more important than outcomes. Experience is more valuable than dreams. As Wayne Gretzky said, you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. Take your shot. Find your answer. You’ll be better off for it.</p>
<p>Failure is at least an answer, not knowing is far worse.</p>
